# Machine learning

## Regresion Lineal

Machine learning was defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." 

The Support Vector Machine (SVM), for example, was created by Vladimir Vapnik in the Soviet Union in 1963, but largely went unnoticed until the 90s when Vapnik was scooped out the Soviet Union to the United States by Bell Labs. The neural network was conceived in the 1940's, but computers at the time were nowhere near powerful enough to run them well, and have not been until the relatively recent times.
